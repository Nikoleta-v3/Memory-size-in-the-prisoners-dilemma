\maketitle

To the editors,
 
The Prisoner's Dilemma has been used for decades to explain human interactions
and the emergence of cooperation amongst us. A paper published in
2012~\cite{Press2012} stated that the best action one can take when playing a
Prisoner's Dilemma game is to manipulate their opponent and ensure victory
whilst not needing to remember much of their past interactions. A rapidly
expanding literature following~\cite{Press2012} questioned these results and
have since then established that memory-one strategies must be forgiving to be
evolutionarily stable~\cite{adami2013} and that longer-memory strategies have
a certain advantage over short memory strategies~\cite{Hilbe2017}.

This manuscript presents further evidence downplaying the findings
of~\cite{Press2012}. It reinforces the discussion that the best action is
adaptability not manipulation and that short memory can be limiting. This is
done by exploring the full space of memory-one strategies, and more specifically, the best
responses of memory-one strategies. We introduce a well designed framework which
allow us to identify the best response memory-one strategy against a given set
of opponents and to compare an optimal memory-one strategy and a more complex
strategy which has a larger memory. It is also used to identify conditions for
which defection is stable; thus identifying environments where cooperation will
not occur.
 
The framework which is introduced in this manuscript can be used for the
continued understanding of best responses in the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma and the
emergence (or not) of cooperative behaviour in complex dynamics, and thus we
believe that our paper would be a great addition to the journal.
