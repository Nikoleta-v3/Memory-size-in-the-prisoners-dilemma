\begin{abstract}
    Memory-one strategies are a set of Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma strategies
    that have been praised for their mathematical tractability and performance
    against single opponents. This manuscript investigates \textit{best
    response} memory-one strategies as a multidimensional
    optimisation problem. Though extortionate memory-one strategies have gained
    much attention, we demonstrate that best response memory-one strategies do not
    behave in an extortionate way, and moreover, for memory one strategies to be
    evolutionary robust they need to be able to behave in a forgiving way. We
    also provide evidence that memory-one strategies suffer from their limited
    memory in multi agent interactions and can be out performed by
    longer memory strategies.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}

The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is a two player game used in understanding the
evolution of co-operative behaviour, formally introduced in~\cite{Flood1958}.
Each player has two options, to cooperate (C) or to defect (D). The decisions
are made simultaneously and independently. The normal form representation of the
game is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{equ:pd_definition}
    S_p =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        R & S  \\
        T & P
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    S_q =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        R & T  \\
        S & P
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where \(S_p\) represents the utilities of the row player and \(S_q\) the
utilities of the column player. The payoffs, \((R, P, S, T)\), are constrained
by equations~(\ref{eq:pd_constrain_one}) and~(\ref{eq:pd_constrain_two}).
Constraint~(\ref{eq:pd_constrain_one}) ensures that
defection dominates cooperation and constraint~(\ref{eq:pd_constrain_two})
ensures that there is a dilemma; the sum of the utilities for both players is
better when both choose to cooperate. The most common values used in the literature are
\((R, P, S, T) = (3, 1, 0, 5)\)~\cite{Axelrod1981}.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:pd_constrain_one}
    T > R > P > S
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pd_constrain_two}
    2R > T + S
\end{equation}

The PD is a one shot game, however it is commonly studied in a manner where the
history of the interactions matters. The repeated form of the game is called the
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) and in the 1980s, following the work
of~\cite{Axelrod1980a, Axelrod1980b} it attracted the attention of the
scientific community. In~\cite{Axelrod1980a} and~\cite{Axelrod1980b}, the first
well known computer tournaments of the IPD were performed. A total of 13 and 62
strategies were submitted respectively in the form of computer code. The
contestants competed against each other, a copy of themselves and a random
strategy, and the winner was then decided on the average score achieved (not the
total number of wins). The contestants were given access to the entire history
of a match, however, how many turns of history a strategy would incorporate,
refereed to as the \textit{memory size} of a strategy, was a result of the
particular strategic decisions made by the author. The winning strategy of both
tournaments was the strategy called Tit for Tat and it's success, in both
tournaments, came as a surprise. Tit for Tat was a simple, forgiving strategy
that opened each interaction by cooperation, but it had managed to defeat far
more complicated opponents. Tit for Tat provided evidence that being nice can be
advantageous and became the major paradigm for reciprocal altruism.

Another trait of Tit for Tat is that it considers only the previous move of the
opponent. These type of strategies are called \textit{reactive} \cite{Nowak1989}
and are a subset of so called \textit{memory-one} strategies, which incorporate
both players' latests moves. Memory-one strategies have been
studied thoroughly in the literature~\cite{Nowak1990, Nowak1993}, however, they have gained
most of their attention when a certain subset of memory-one strategies was
introduced in~\cite{Press2012}, the zero-determinants. In~\cite{Stewart2012} it
was stated that ``Press and Dyson have fundamentally changed the viewpoint on
the Prisoner's Dilemma''.

Zero-determinants are a special case of memory-one and extortionate
strategies. They chose their actions so that a linear relationship is forced
between the players' score ensuring that they will always
receive at least as much as their opponents. Zero-determinant strategies are
indeed mathematically unique and are proven to be robust in pairwise
interactions, however, their true effectiveness in tournaments and
evolutionary dynamics has been questioned~\cite{adami2013, Knight2018,
Harper2015}.

In a similar fashion to~\cite{Press2012} the purpose of this work is to consider
a given memory-one strategy; however, whilst~\cite{Press2012} found a way for a
player to manipulate a given opponent, this work will consider a
multidimensional optimisation approach to identify the best response to a given
group of opponents. In particular, this work presents a compact method of
identifying the best response memory-one strategy against a given set of
opponents and evaluate whether it behaves extortionately, similar to
zero-determinants. Further theoretical and empirical results of this work
include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The factors that make a best response memory-one strategy evolutionary
    robust.
    \item A well designed framework that allows the comparison of an optimal
          memory one strategy, and a more complex strategy that has a larger
          memory and was obtained through contemporary reinforcement learning
          techniques~\cite{Harper2017}.
    \item An identification of conditions for which defection is known to be a
    best response; thus identifying environments where cooperation will not
    occur.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The utility}\label{section:utility}

One specific advantage of memory-one strategies is their mathematical
tractability. They can be represented completely as an element of \(\R^{4}_{[0, 1]}\). This
originates from~\cite{Nowak1989} where it is stated that if a strategy is
concerned with only the outcome of a single turn then there are four possible
`states' the strategy could be in; \(CC, CD, DC,CC\). Therefore, a memory-one
strategy can be denoted by the probability vector of cooperating after each of
these states; \(p=(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) \in \R_{[0,1]} ^ 4\).

In~\cite{Nowak1989} it was shown that it is not necessary to simulate the play
of a strategy $p$ against a memory-one opponent $q$. Rather this exact behaviour
can be modeled as a stochastic process, and more specifically as a Markov chain
(Figure~\ref{fig:markov_chain}) whose corresponding transition matrix \(M\)
is given by (\ref{eq:transition_matrix}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includestandalone[width=.35\textwidth]{tex/markov_chain}
    \caption{Markov Chain}
    \label{fig:markov_chain}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:transition_matrix}
    \input{tex/m_matrix.tex}
\end{equation}

The long run steady state probability vector \(v\) is the solution to \(v M =
v\). The stationary vector \(v\) combined with the payoff matrices of
(\ref{equ:pd_definition}) give the expected payoffs for each player. More
specifically, the utility for a memory-one strategy \(p\) against an opponent
\(q\), denoted as \(u_q(p)\), is defined by,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:press_dyson_utility}
    u_q(p) = v \cdot (R, S, T, P).
\end{equation}

To the authors knowledge there has been no previous work which explored the form
of \(u_q(p)\) any further. This manuscript proves that \(u_q(p)\) is given by a
ratio of two quadratic forms~\cite{kepner2011}, as presented in
Theorem~\ref{theorem:quadratic_form_u}.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:quadratic_form_u}
    The expected utility of a memory-one strategy \(p\in\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}^4\)
    against a memory-one opponent \(q\in\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}^4\), denoted
    as \(u_q(p)\), can be written as a ratio of two quadratic forms:

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:optimisation_quadratic}
    u_q(p) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}pQp^T + cp + a}
                {\frac{1}{2}p\bar{Q}p^T + \bar{c}p + \bar{a}},
    \end{equation}
    where \(Q, \bar{Q}\) \(\in \R^{4\times4}\) are square matrices whose
    diagonal elements are all equal to zero, and are defined by the
    transition probabilities of the opponent \(q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4\) as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{equation}
    \resizebox{0.9\linewidth}{!}{\arraycolsep=2.5pt%
    \boldmath\(
    Q = \input{tex/q_numerator}\)},
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:q_bar_matrix}
    \resizebox{0.8\linewidth}{!}{\arraycolsep=2.5pt%
    \boldmath\(
    \bar{Q} =  \input{tex/q_denominator}\)}.
    \end{equation}
    \end{center}

    \(c \text{ and } \bar{c}\) \(\in \R^{4 \times 1}\) are similarly defined by:

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:q_matrix_numerator}
    \resizebox{0.3\linewidth}{!}{\arraycolsep=2.5pt%
    \boldmath\(c = \input{tex/c_numerator}\),}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:q_matrix_denominator}
    \resizebox{0.3\linewidth}{!}{\arraycolsep=2.5pt%
    \boldmath\(\bar{c} = \input{tex/c_denominator}\),
    }
    \end{equation}
    and the constant terms \(a, \bar{a}\) are defined as \(a = \input{tex/numerator_constant}\) and
    \(\bar{a} = \input{tex/denominator_constant}\).
\end{theorem}

The proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:quadratic_form_u} is given in Appendix~\ref{appendix:proof_theorem_one}.

Numerical simulations have been carried out to validate the formulation of
\(u_q(p)\) as a quadratic ratio. The simulated utility, which is denoted as
\(U_q(p)\), has been calculated using~\cite{axelrodproject} an open source
research framework for the study of the IPD~\footnote{The project is described
in~\cite{Knight2016}.}. For smoothing the simulated results the
simulated utility has been estimated in a tournament of 500 turns and 200
repetitions. Figure~\ref{fig:analytical_simulated} shows that the formulation
of Theorem~\ref{theorem:quadratic_form_u} successfully
captures the simulated behaviour.

The source code used in this manuscript has been written in a sustainable manner.
It is open source (\url{https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/Memory-size-in-the-prisoners-dilemma})
and tested which ensures the validity of the results. It has also been archived

Theorem~\ref{theorem:quadratic_form_u} can be extended to consider multiple
opponents. The IPD is commonly studied in tournaments and/or Moran Processes
where a strategy interacts with a number of opponents. The payoff of a player in
such interactions is given by the average payoff the player received against
each opponent. More specifically the expected utility of a memory-one strategy
against a \(N\) number of opponents is given by
Theorem~\ref{theorem:tournament_utility}.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:tournament_utility}
    The expected utility of a memory-one strategy \(p\in\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}^4\)
    against a group of opponents \(q^{(1)}, q^{(2)}, \dots, q^{(N)}\), denoted
    as \(\frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} {u_q}^{(i)} (p)\), is given by:

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:tournament_utility}
        \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} {u_q}^{(i)} (p) = \frac{1}{N}
        \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} (\frac{1}{2} pQ^{(i)} p^T + c^{(i)} p + a^ {(i)})
        \prod\limits_{\tiny\begin{array}{l} j=1 \\ j \neq i \end{array}} ^
        N (\frac{1}{2} p\bar{Q}^{(j)} p^T + \bar{c}^{(j)} p + \bar{a}^ {(j)})}
        {\prod\limits_{i=1} ^ N (\frac{1}{2} p\bar{Q}^{(i)} p^T + \bar{c}^{(i)} p + \bar{a}^ {(i)})}.
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

The proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:tournament_utility} is a straightforward algebraic
manipulation.

Similar to the previous result, the formulation of
Theorem~\ref{theorem:tournament_utility} is validated using numerical
simulations where the 10 memory-one strategies described in~\cite{Stewart2012}
have been used as the opponents. Figure~\ref{fig:stewart_plotkin_results} shows
that the simulated behaviour has been captured successfully.

    against the 10 memory-one strategies described in~\cite{Stewart2012}.}
    \label{fig:stewart_plotkin_results}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The list of strategies from~\cite{Stewart2012} was also used to check whether
the utility against a group of strategies could be captured by the utility
against the mean opponent. Thus whether condition (\ref{eq:condition}) holds.
However condition~(\ref{eq:condition}) fails, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:hypothesis}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:condition}
    \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1} ^ {N} {u_q}^{(i)} (p) = u_{\frac {1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ N q^{(i)}}(p),
\end{equation}

    \label{fig:hypothesis}
\end{figure}

In this section two theoretical results were presented. The formulation of
Theorem~\ref{theorem:tournament_utility} which allows for the utility of a
memory-one strategy against any number of opponents to be estimated without
simulating the interactions is the main result used in this manuscript. In
Section~\ref{section:best_response_mem_one} it is used to  define best response
memory-one strategies and explore the conditions under which defection dominates
cooperation.

\section{Best responses to memory-one players}\label{section:best_response_mem_one}

This section focused on best responses and more specifically \textit{memory-one
best response} strategies. A \textit{best response} is the strategy which
corresponds to the most favorable outcome~\cite{Tadelis2013}, thus a memory-one
best response corresponds to a strategy \(p^*\) for which
(\ref{eq:tournament_utility}) is maximised. This is considered as a multi
dimensional optimisation problem given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:mo_tournament_optimisation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \max_p: & \ \sum_{i=1} ^ {N} {u_q}^{(i)} (p)
    \\
    \text{such that}: & \ p \in \R_{[0, 1]}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Optimising this particular ratio of quadratic forms is not trivial. It can be
verified empirically for the case of a single opponent that there exist at least
one point for which the definition of concavity does not hold. Some results are
known for non concave ratios of quadratic forms~\cite{Beck2009, Hongyan2014},
however, in these works it's assumed that either both the numerator and the
denominator of the fractional problem are concave or that the denominator is
greater than zero. Both assumptions fail here as stated in Theorem~\ref{theorem:concavity}.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:concavity}
    The utility of a player \(p\) against an opponent \(q\), \(u_q (p)\), given
    by (\ref{eq:optimisation_quadratic}), is not concave. Furthermore neither
    the numerator or the denominator of (\ref{eq:optimisation_quadratic}), are
    concave or greater than zero.
\end{theorem}

Proof is given in Appendix~\ref{appendix:proof_theorem_three}.

The non concavity of \(u(p)\) indicates multiple local optimal points. The
approach taken here is to introduce a compact way of constructing the candidate
set of all local optimal points. Once the set is defined the point that
maximises (\ref{eq:tournament_utility}) corresponds to the best response
strategy. The problem considered is bounded because \(p \in \R^4_{[0, 1]}\).
Therefore, the candidate solutions will exist either at the boundaries of the
feasible solution space, or within that space (the methods of Lagrange
Multipliers~\cite{bertsekas2014} and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
conditions~\cite{Giorgi2016} are based on this). This approach allow us to
define the best response memory-one strategy to a group of opponents in the
following Lemma:

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:memone_group_best_response}

    The optimal behaviour of a memory-one strategy player
    \(p^* \in \R_{[0, 1]} ^ 4\)
    against a set of \(N\) opponents \(\{q^{(1)}, q^{(2)}, \dots, q^{(N)} \}\)
    for \(q^{(i)} \in \R_{[0, 1]} ^ 4\) is established by:

    \[p^* = \textnormal{argmax}\left(\sum\limits_{i=1} ^ N  u_q(p)\right), \ p \in S_q.\]

    The set \(S_q\) is defined as all the possible combinations of:

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:s_q_set}
        S_q =
        \left\{p \in \mathbb{R} ^ 4 \left|
            \begin{aligned}
                \bullet\quad p_j \in \{0, 1\} & \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d}{dp_k} 
                \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ N  u_q^{(i)}(p) = 0
                \quad \text{forall} \quad j \in J \quad \&  \quad k \in K  \quad \text{forall} \quad J, K \\
                & \quad \text{where} \quad J \cap K = \O \quad
                \text{and} \quad J \cup K = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.\\
                \bullet\quad  p \in \{0, 1\} ^ 4
            \end{aligned}\right.
        \right\}.
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}

The proof is given in the Appendix~\ref{appendix:proof_lemma_four}.

Note that there is no immediate way to find the zeros of \(\frac{d}{dp} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ N  u_q(p)\);

{\small
\begin{align}\label{eq:mo_tournament_derivative}
    \frac{d}{dp} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} {u_q}^{(i)} (p) & = \nonumber \\
    & =  \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N}
    \frac{\left(pQ^{(i)} + c^{(i)}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2} p\bar{Q}^{(i)} p^T + \bar{c}^{(i)} p + \bar{a}^ {(i)}\right)
    - \left(p\bar{Q}^{(i)} + \bar{c}^{(i)}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2} pQ^{(i)} p^T + c^{(i)} p + a^ {(i)}\right)}
    {\left(\frac{1}{2} p\bar{Q}^{(i)} p^T + \bar{c}^{(i)} p + \bar{a}^ {(i)}\right)^ 2}
\end{align}
}

For \(\frac{d}{dp} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ N  u_q(p)\) to equal zero then:

{\scriptsize
\begin{align}\label{eq:polynomials_roots}
    \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} \left(
    \left(pQ^{(i)} + c^{(i)}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2} p\bar{Q}^{(i)} p^T + \bar{c}^{(i)} p + \bar{a}^ {(i)}\right)
    - \left(p\bar{Q}^{(i)} + \bar{c}^{(i)}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2} pQ^{(i)} p^T + c^{(i)} p + a^ {(i)}\right)\right)
    &= 0, \quad {while} \\
    \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} \frac{1}{2} p\bar{Q}^{(i)} p^T + \bar{c}^{(i)} p + \bar{a}^ {(i)} &\neq 0.
\end{align}}

Finding best response memory-one strategies, more specifically constructing the
subset \(S_q\), can done analytically. The points for any or all of \(p_i \in
\{0, 1\}\) for \(i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) are trivial, and finding the
roots of the partial derivatives which are a set of polynomials of equations
(\ref{eq:polynomials_roots}) is feasible using resultant
theory~\cite{Jonsson2005}; however, for large systems building the resultant quickly becomes
intractable. As a result, a numerical method taking advantage of the structure
will be used for finding best response memory-one strategies. This will be described
in Section~\ref{section:numerical_experiments}. The rest of
the section focuses on an immediate theoretical result from
Lemma~\ref{lemma:memone_group_best_response}.

\subsection{Stability of defection}\label{subsection:stability_of_defection}

An immediate result from Lemma~\ref{lemma:memone_group_best_response} can be
obtained by evaluating the sign of the derivative
(\ref{eq:mo_tournament_derivative}) at \(p=(0, 0, 0, 0)\). If at that point the
derivative is negative, then a player maximises their utility
by playing as a defector, and their utility would only decrease if they were
to change their behaviour. Thus, defection is the best response.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:stability_of_defection}
    In a tournament of \(N\) players \(\{q^{(1)}, q^{(2)}, \dots, q^{(N)} \}\)
    for \(q^{(i)} \in \R_{[0, 1]} ^ 4\)
    defection is a best response if the transition probabilities of the
    opponents satisfy conditions (\ref{eq:defection_condition_one}) and (\ref{eq:defection_condition_two}).

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:defection_condition_one}
        \sum_{i=1} ^ N (c^{(i)T} \bar{a}^{(i)} - \bar{c}^{(i)T} a^{(i)}) \leq 0
    \end{equation}

    while,

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:defection_condition_two}
        \sum_{i=1} ^ N \bar{a}^{(i)} \neq 0
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    For defection to be a best response the derivative of the utility
    at the point \(p = (0, 0, 0, 0)\) must be negative. This would indicate that
    the utility function is only declining from that point onwards.

    Substituting \(p = (0, 0, 0, 0)\) in
    equation~(\ref{eq:mo_tournament_derivative}) gives:

    \begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1} ^ N \frac{(c^{(i)T} \bar{a}^{(i)} - \bar{c}^{(i)T} a^{(i)})}
    {(\bar{a}^{(i)})^2}
    \end{equation}

    The sign of the numerator \( \displaystyle\sum_{i=1} ^ N (c^{(i)T} \bar{a}^{(i)} - \bar{c}^{(i)T} a^{(i)})\)
    can vary based on the transition probabilities of the opponents.
    The denominator can not be negative, and otherwise is always positive.
    Thus the sign of the derivative is negative if and only if
    \( \displaystyle\sum_{i=1} ^ N (c^{(i)T} \bar{a}^{(i)} - \bar{c}^{(i)T} a^{(i)}) \leq 0\).
\end{proof}

In an environment where defection is the best response the average payoff of a
defector is always higher than any other strategy can achieve. If a
setting where in each the prevalence of each type of strategy was determined by
that strategy's success in the previous round is considered, then in a population such that
(\ref{eq:defection_condition_one}) and (\ref{eq:defection_condition_two}) hold,
defection would prevail; thus cooperation would never occur.
This is demonstrated in Figures~\ref{fig:stable_defection} and~\ref{fig:unstable_defection}.
Lemma~\ref{lemma:stability_of_defection} is the last theoretical result presented
in this manuscript. The following section focuses on numerical experiments.

\section{Numerical experiments} \label{section:numerical_experiments}

The results of this section rely on estimating memory-one best responses, but as stated in
Section~\ref{section:best_response_mem_one}, estimating best responses
analytically can quickly become an intractable problem. As a result, best
responses will be estimated heuristically using Bayesian
optimisation~\cite{Mokus1978}. Bayesian optimisation is a global optimisation
algorithm that has proven to outperform many other popular
algorithms~\cite{Jones2001}. The algorithm builds a bayesian understanding of
the objective function which it is well suited to the multiple local optimas in
the described search area of this work. Differential evolution~\cite{Storn1997}
was also considered, however it was not selected due to Bayesian being
computationally more efficient.

As an example of the algorithm's usage let's consider the optimisation problem of
(\ref{eq:mo_tournament_optimisation}). Figure~\ref{bayesian_example}
illustrates the change of the utility function over iterations of the algorithm.
The default number of iterations that has been used in this work is 60. After 60
calls the convergence of the utility is checked. If the optimised utility has
changed in the last 10\% iterations then a further 20 iterations are considered.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{img/bayesian_example.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Utility over time of calls using Bayesian optimisation. The
    opponents are \(q^{(1)} = (\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3},
    \frac{1}{3})\) and \(q^{(2)} = (\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3},
    \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3})\). The best response obtained is \(p^* = (0, \frac{11}{50}, 0, 0)\)}
    \label{bayesian_example}
\end{figure}

The rest of the section is structured as follows. In
Section~\ref{subsection:best_response_n_2}, Bayesian optimisation is used to
generate a data set containing memory-one best responses against a number of
random opponents. The extortionate behaviour of these best
responses is then evaluated using a method introduced in~\cite{Knight2019}. In Section
\ref{subsection:best_respnse_evolutionary_setting}, a similar data set and approach
is discussed but this time the best responses are memory-one best responses
to a number of opponents and a copy of themselves.
Finally, Section~\ref{subsection:longer_memory_best_response} compares
the performances of memory-one and longer-memory best responses against a number
of opponents.

\subsection{Best response memory-one strategies for \(N=2\)}\label{subsection:best_response_n_2}

As briefly discussed in Section~\ref{section:introduction}, zero-determinants
have been praised for their robustness against a single opponent.
Zero-determinants' extortionate behaviour reassures that the strategies will
never lose a game. Though extortion works in pairwise interactions, this paper
argues that in multi opponent interactions, where the payoffs matter, strategies
trying to exploit their opponents suffer.

Compared to zero-determinants, best response memory-one strategies, that
have a theory of mind of their opponents, utilise their behaviour in order to
gain the most from their interactions. The question that arises then is whether
best response strategies are the optimal because they behave in an extortionate
way. To estimate a strategy's extortionate
behaviour the SSE method as described in~\cite{Knight2019} is used. SSE is
defined as how far a strategy is from behaving extortionate, thus a high
SSE implies a non extortionate behaviour.

A data set of best response memory-one strategies when \(N=2\) has been
generated which is available at~\cite{glynatsi2019}. The data set contains a total of 1000 trials
corresponding to 1000 different instances of a best response strategy. For each
trial a set of 2 opponents is randomly generated and the memory-one best response
against them is estimated. Though the probabilities \(q_i\) of the opponents are
randomly generated, Figures~\ref{fig:first_opponents_probabilities} and
\ref{fig:second_opponents_probabilities}, show that they are uniformly
distributed over the trials. Thus, the full space of possible opponents has been
covered.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/first_opponent_probabilities.pdf}
        \subcaption{Distributions of first opponents' probabilities.}
        \label{fig:first_opponents_probabilities}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/second_opponent_probabilities.pdf}
        \subcaption{Distributions of second opponents' probabilities.}
        \label{fig:second_opponents_probabilities}
    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The SSE method has been applied to the data set. It's distribution is given in
Figure~\ref{fig:sserror_mem_one} and a statistics summary in
Table~\ref{table:sserror_stats}. The distribution of SSE is skewed to the left,
indicating that the best response does exhibit extortionate behaviour, however,
the best response is not uniformly extortionate. A positive measure of skewness
and kurtosis indicates a heavy tail to the right. Therefore, in several cases the
strategy is not trying to extortionate the opponents.

So though the best response strategy can exhibit extortionate behaviour, it's
performance is maximised by behaving in a more adaptable way than zero-determinant
strategies. This analysis is extended to an evolutionary setting.

\subsection{Memory-one best responses in evolutionary dynamics}\label{subsection:best_respnse_evolutionary_setting}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{section:utility}, the IPD is commonly studied in
Moran processes, and generally, in evolutionary processes. In these processes self
interactions are key. This section extends the formulation of best responses
to evolutionary settings, more specifically, the optimisation problem of
(\ref{eq:mo_tournament_optimisation}) is extended to
include self interactions.

Self interactions can be incorporated in the formulation
that has been used so far. The utility is given by,

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} {u_q}^{(i)} (p) + u_p(p).
\end{equation}

and the optimisation problem of (\ref{eq:mo_tournament_optimisation}) is re written as,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:mo_evolutionary_optimisation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \max_p: & \ \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} {u_q}^{(i)} (p) + u_p(p)
    \\
    \text{such that}: & \ p \in \R_{[0, 1]}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

% Note that exact formulate are known for given evolutionary processes, however,
% for simplicity 17 is given to optimisation.
For determining the memory-one best response in an evolutionary setting,
an algorithmic approach is considered, called \textit{best
response dynamics}. Best response dynamics are commonly used in evolutionary
game theory. They represent a class of strategy updating rules, where players in
the next round are determined by their best responses to some subset of the
population. The best response dynamics approach used in this manuscript is given by
Algorithm~\ref{algo:best_response_dynamics}.

\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
    \begin{algorithm}[H]
        $p^{(t)}\leftarrow (1, 1, 1, 1)$\;
        \While{$p^{(t)} \neq p ^{(t -1)}$}{
         $p^{(t + 1)} =  \text{argmax} \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ {N} {u_q}^{(i)}
         (p^{(t + 1)}) + u_p^{(t)}(p^{(t + 1)})$\;
        }
        \caption{Best response dynamics Algorithm}
        \label{algo:best_response_dynamics}
    \end{algorithm}
\end{minipage}

The best response dynamics algorithm starts by setting an initial
solution \(p^{(1)}=(1, 1, 1, 1)\), and repeatedly finds a strategy that maximises
(\ref{eq:mo_evolutionary_optimisation}) using Bayesian optimisation. The
algorithm stops once a cycle (a sequence of iterated evaluated points) is
detected. A numerical example of the algorithm is given in Figure~\ref{fig:best_response_dynamics_results}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{img/evolution_example_two.pdf}
    \caption{Best response dynamics with \(N=2\). More specifically, for
    \(q ^{(1)}=(\frac{59}{250},
                \frac{1031}{10000},
                \frac{99}{250},
                \frac{1549}{10000})\) and
    \(q ^{(2)}=(\frac{133}{2000},
                \frac{803}{2000},
                \frac{9179}{10000},
                \frac{2001}{2500})\).}
\label{fig:best_response_dynamics_results}
\end{figure}

The algorithm has been used to estimate the best response in an evolutionary
setting for each of the 1000 pairs of opponents described in
Section~\ref{subsection:best_response_n_2}. These are also included in the data
set~\cite{glynatsi2019}, and moreover, the SSE method has also been applied. The
distribution of SSE is given by Figure~\ref{fig:sserror_mem_one} and a
statistical summary by Table~\ref{table:sserror_stats}.

Similarly to the results of Section~\ref{subsection:best_response_n_2}, the
evolutionary best response strategy does not behave uniformly extortionate. A
larger value of both the kurtosis and the skewness of the SSE distribution
indicates that in evolutionary settings a memory-one best response is even more
adaptable.

The difference between best responses in tournaments and in evolutionary
settings are further explored by Figure~\ref{fig:behaviour_violin_plots}.
Though, Table~\ref{table:wilcoxon_tests} details that no statistically
significant differences has been found, from
Figure~\ref{fig:behaviour_violin_plots}, it seems that evolutionary best
response has a higher $p_2$ median. Thus, they more likely to forgive after
being tricked.

\subsection{Longer memory best response}\label{subsection:longer_memory_best_response}

This section focuses on the memory size of strategies. The effectiveness of
memory in the IPD has been previously explored in the literature, as
discussed in Section~\ref{section:introduction}, however, none of the
previous works has compared the performance of longer-memory strategies to
memory-one best responses.

In~\cite{Harper2017}, a strategy called \textit{Gambler} which makes
probabilistic decisions based on the opponent's \(n_1\) first moves, the
opponent's \(m_1\) last moves and the player's \(m_2\) last moves was
introduced. In this manuscript Gambler $n_1 = 2, m_1 = 1$ and $m_2 = 1$ is used
as the longer-memory strategy.

By considering the opponent's first two moves, the opponents last move and the
player's last move, there are only 16 $(4 \times 2 \times 2)$ possible outcomes
that can occur, furthermore, Gambler also makes a probabilistic decision of
cooperating in the opening move. Thus, Gambler is a function \(f: \{\text{C,
D}\}^{16 \cup 1} \rightarrow (0, 1)_{\R}\). This can be hard coded as an element
of \([0, 1]_{\R} ^ {16 + 1}\), one probability for each outcome plus the opening
move. Hence, compared to (\ref{eq:mo_tournament_optimisation}), finding an
optimal Gambler is a 17 dimensional problem given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gambler_optimisation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \max_p: & \ \sum_{i=1} ^ {N} {U_q}^{(i)} (f)
    \\
    \text{such that}: & \ f \in \R_{[0, 1]}^{17}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Note that (\ref{eq:tournament_utility}) can not be used here for the utility
of Gambler, and actual simulated players are used. This is done using~\cite{axelrodproject}
with 500 turns and 200 repetitions, moreover, (\ref{eq:gambler_optimisation})
is solved numerically using Bayesian optimisation.

Similarly to previous sections, a large data set has been generated with
instances of an optimal Gambler and a memory-one best response, available
at~\cite{glynatsi2019}. For each trial two random opponents have been selected.
The distributions of their transition probabilities are given in Figures
\ref{fig:first_opponents_probabilities_with_gambler} and
\ref{fig:first_opponents_probabilities_with_gambler}. The results of this section
are base on a total of 130 trials.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/first_opponent_probabilities_with_gambler.pdf}
        \subcaption{Distributions of first opponents' probabilities for longer memory experiment.}
        \label{fig:first_opponents_probabilities_with_gambler}

    \begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
        \centering

        \subcaption{Distributions of second opponents' probabilities for longer memory experiment.}
        \label{fig:second_opponents_probabilities_with_gambler}
    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The utilities of both strategies are plotted against each other in
Figure~\ref{fig:utilities_gambler_mem_one}. Though Gambler has an infinite
memory (in order to remember the opening moves of the opponent) the information
the strategy considers is not significantly larger than memory-one strategies.
Even so, it is evident from Figure~\ref{fig:utilities_gambler_mem_one} that
Gambler will always performs the same or better. This seems to be at odd with the
result of~\cite{Press2012} that against a memory-one opponent having a longer memory
will not give a strategy any
advantage. However, against two memory-one opponents Gambler performs better than
the optimal memory-one strategy, thus having a shorter memory in this setting is limiting.

\section{Conclusion}

This manuscript considers \textit{best response} strategies in the IPD game, and
more specifically, \textit{memory-one best responses}. It has proven that there is
a compact way of identifying a memory-one best response to a group of opponents,
and moreover, that there exists a condition for which in an
environment of memory-one opponents defection is the dominant and stable choice.
The later parts of this paper focused on a series of empirical results where it
was shown that the performance and the evolutionary stability of memory-one
strategies rely not on extortion but on adaptability. Finally, it was shown that
memory-one strategies' performance is limited by their memory in cases where
they interact with multiple opponents.

Following the work described in~\cite{Nowak1989}, where it was shown that the
utility between two memory-one strategies can be estimated by a Markov
stationary state, we proved that the utilities can be written as a ration of two
quadratic forms in $R^4$, Theorem~\ref{theorem:quadratic_form_u}. This was
extended to include multiple opponents as the IPD is commonly studied in such
situations, Theorem~\ref{theorem:tournament_utility}.
The formulation of Theorem~\ref{theorem:tournament_utility} and the result that
the utility has a form allowed us to introduce an approach for identifying
memory-one best responses to any number of opponents,
Lemma~\ref{lemma:memone_group_best_response}. This does not only have game
theoretic novelty, but also a mathematical novelty of solving quadratic ratio
optimisation problem where the quadratics are non concave. The results of
Lemma~\ref{lemma:memone_group_best_response} were also used to define a
condition for which defection is known to be a best response.

This manuscript also presented empirical results. These results were mainly to
investigate the behaviour of memory-one strategies and their limitations. In
Sections~\ref{subsection:best_response_n_2}
and~\ref{subsection:best_respnse_evolutionary_setting}, a large data set which
contained best responses in tournaments and in evolutionary settings for $N=2$
was generated. This allowed us to investigate their respective behaviours and
whether it was extortionate acts that made them most favorable strategies.
However, it was shown that it was not extortion but adaptability that allowed
the strategies to gain the most from their interactions.
In evolutionary settings it was specifically shown that being adaptable and being
able to forgive after being tricked were key factors. In Section~\ref{subsection:longer_memory_best_response}, the performance of
memory-one strategies was put against the performance of a longer memory
strategy called Gambler. There were several cases where Gambler would outperform
the memory-one strategy, however a memory-one strategy never managed to outperform
a Gambler. This result occurred whilst considering a Gambler with a sufficiently
larger memory but not a sufficiently larger amount of information regarding
the game.

All the empirical results presented in this manuscript have been for the
case of $N=2$. In future work we would consider larger values of $N$, however, we
believe that for larger values of $N$ the results that have been presented here would
only be more evident.
