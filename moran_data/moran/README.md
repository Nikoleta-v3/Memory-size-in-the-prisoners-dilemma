Data collection for the Moran process.

Running `main.py` will generate (or append to) `main.csv` with random
experiments for the Moran process (with N=4) with an optimal memory 1 player that updates
at every generation.

To run:

```
$ python main.py
```

The data set is of the form:

```
Experiment number, Step, Optimal p1, Optimal p2, Optimal p3, Optimal p4, Opponent 1, Opponent 2, Opponent 3, Optimal player count, Opponent 1 count, Opponent 2 count, Opponent 3 count
```
