To the Editorial Board Member,

Thank you very much for reviewing our manuscript, and we would like to extend
our gratitude to the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and suggestions. We
have fully taken their comments on board and made significant modifications to
both the mathematical arguments and the narrative. We feel this has greatly
improved the work.
%TODO say we are sorry that the evolutionary part was misleading.

Please find attached a point-by-point response to reviewer's concerns. We hope
that you find our responses satisfactory.

The Authors.
